# 📞 Contact Manager - Default Calling App

## 📌 Overview  
**Contact Manager** is an Android application developed using Kotlin that functions as a **default calling app**. It provides essential call management functionalities such as handling incoming and outgoing calls, maintaining call logs, and managing contacts.

The app utilizes the **system’s default dialer interface** for handling calls.

## ✨ Features  
✔️ **Incoming Call Management** – Accept or reject incoming calls  
✔️ **Outgoing Call Management** – Initiate and make outgoing calls  
✔️ **Call Logs** – Keep a record of all incoming, outgoing, and missed calls  
✔️ **Contacts Management** – View and manage contacts  
✔️ **Default Calling App** – Can be set as the primary calling app on the device

## 🛠️ Testing
1. Case 1 : Test the app without setting it as default
2. Case 2 : Test the app with setting it as default
   for better experience

##  Note  
Since the system dialer UI is not accessible when an app is set as the default dialer , calls will work as expected (audio will be functional), but there will be no visual interface for handling the call (e.g., accept/reject buttons or an in-call screen).
